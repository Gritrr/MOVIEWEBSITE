        <h2 class="movie-title">Whiplash</h2>  
        <p style="font-style: italic;">
            A psychological drama that focuses on the intense relationship between a young jazz drummer, Andrew Neiman (played by Miles Teller), and his ruthless music instructor, Terence Fletcher (played by J.K. Simmons).

Set in a prestigious music conservatory, the film follows Andrew's determination to become one of the best drummers in the world. He idolizes the great jazz musicians and is willing to sacrifice everything, including his personal life and well-being, to achieve his goal.

Andrew’s mentor, Fletcher, is an unforgiving and domineering teacher who believes in pushing his students to their limits. He uses extreme methods, including verbal abuse and emotional manipulation, to get the best performances out of his students. Fletcher’s motto is "The worst thing you can be is a second-rate musician," and he is willing to push Andrew past the breaking point to reach greatness.

The tension between Andrew's desire to succeed and Fletcher’s brutal teaching style forms the core of the movie. Andrew faces physical and emotional exhaustion, constantly struggling to meet Fletcher's impossible expectations. The film explores themes of ambition, the cost of success, the price of artistic greatness, and the toxic nature of perfectionism.

Whiplash delves into the psychology of both the student and the teacher, showcasing the extremes they are willing to go to in pursuit of excellence. J.K. Simmons received widespread acclaim for his portrayal of Fletcher, earning an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. The film is intense, fast-paced, and often leaves the viewer questioning the true cost of achieving greatness.
